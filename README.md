Cleaner Schedule
================

This is a basic webapp that allows us to schedule chores for roommates on a recurring basis, rotating all parties across shared chores

A couple behavioursneed to be built in:

 - Concept of time. The clock should refresh every two weeks from a baseline time (Saturday or Sunday)
 - It should know all the known parties (ie. Aldrich, Karan, Christina)
 - It should know the tasks that need to be done (Shared floors, Shared counter top, bathroom, etc.)
 - It should know which people own a specific task. (ie. the living room is shared with all roommates, but the second bathroom is shared between only two roommates)
 - It should have calendar integration, so a calendar invite is sent to each rooommate's calendar every two weeks.
